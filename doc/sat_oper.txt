Using catctl to operate satellites


When paired with a well-timed shell script using the "sleep" command, you can
use catctl to automatically adjust for doppler shift as the satellite flies
overhead. Please note that this is not a valid substitute for listening for
yourself on the satellite's downlink, but, you might find this to be a valuable
tool for operating FM satellites such as the ISS or AO-91.

Let's design a satellite that has an uplink on 145.990 and a downlink on 
437.800. Since the uplink is on 2 meters, the doppler shift isn't too bad.
However, that 70 centimeter downlink is going to be really drifty during the
sat pass. As such, you would want to use a set of "freq" commands. You could
use a loop, but, it is probably more advisable to have more precise timing
like so:

catctl freq 437.795 /dev/ttyUSB1
sleep 16
catctl freq 437.800 /dev/ttyUSB1
sleep 13
catctl freq 437.805 /dev/ttyUSB1

Of course, this is just an example, and, the fictional satellite here is, 
despite the strong allustion to the Interational Space Station, not the ISS.
