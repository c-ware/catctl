Using catctl to automatically input a repeater shift

To use catctl to automatically load repeaters, simply use commands like this:
mode fm
band 2m
freq 145.490
rptshift -
sql_tenc 8
This selects a repeater with an output on 145.490 MHz, a negative 600kHz (the
default) shift, and an access tone of "8" that corresponds to 88.5 Hz. 

This can easily be automated by reading in values from a CSV file, or an
findex-compatible database. 

Notes:
1. The findex-compatible database reader functionality is currently not
implemented.
2. The CTCSS tone must be entered as a numeric code, not a frequency. You will
want to check catctl.h in order to match up the CTCSS and DCS codes/tones to
their numeric value. 
3. The shift value is currently not changable; the radios that this program
were designed to require a dual-VFO split to achieve a weird offset.
