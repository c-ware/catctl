CATctl

A library to control ham radios using the CAT protocol. Icom's CI-V protocol
is not supported.

Tested radios:
- Yaesu
	- FT-840
	- FT-991

More documentation coming soon. This is not quite production-ready, but it
can be used to an extent now. You will very likely need to modify the 
source to get the correct function for your rig; a finalized version will 
have macros that controls what rig the program is built for.
